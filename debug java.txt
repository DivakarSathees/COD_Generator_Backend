Problem Statement

	Manoj is building a ticketing system where each event has an event ID, name, and ticket price. He wants to create an Event class to store these details and categorize tickets as "VIP" (ticket price ‚â• 2000), "Regular" (ticket price ‚â• 1000), or "Economy" (ticket price < 1000).



However, there are logical issues with method visibility and ticket categorization that prevent the program from functioning as expected.

Your task is to debug the code to properly manage event details and display their categories accurately.


 Input Format 
The input contains the details for a single event:

An integer eventId representing the event's ID.
A string name representing the event's name.
A double ticketPrice representing the event's ticket price.
 Output Format 
For each event, the program will print:

Event ID: <event_id>

Name: <event_name>

Ticket Price: <ticket_price>

Category: <VIP/Regular/Economy>



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

 Constraints 
1 ‚â§ eventId ‚â§ 9999

100.0 ‚â§ ticketPrice ‚â§ 10000.0

 Sample Input 1 
101
Music Fest
800.0
 Sample Output 1 
Event ID: 101
Name: Music Fest
Ticket Price: 800.0
Category: Economy

Problem Statement
Aditi is developing a student management system where each student has a roll number, name, and marks. She wants to create a Student class that:

Uses the this keyword to differentiate between instance variables and method parameters when setting student details.

Uses a static variable to keep track of the total number of students created.

However, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not properly use this for assigning values, and the static counter is not updated correctly.

Your task is to debug the code to correctly manage student details and display the total number of students.

Input Format
The input contains the details for a single student:

An integer rollNo representing the student‚Äôs roll number.

A string name representing the student‚Äôs name.

A double marks representing the student‚Äôs marks.

Output Format
For each student, the program will print:

Roll No: <roll_no>
Name: <student_name>
Marks: <student_marks>
Total Students: <count>
Constraints

Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs make it look like a real debugging exercise.
I‚Äôll give you two versions of the code:

Buggy version (with wrong usage of this and static)

Correct version (after fixing with proper this and static usage)

üîπ Buggy Code (to be debugged)
import java.util.Scanner;

    int rollNo;
    String name;
    double marks;
    static int count = 0;

        System.out.println("Roll No: " + rollNo);
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Marks: " + marks);
        System.out.println("Total Students: " + count);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int rollNo = sc.nextInt();
        sc.nextLine();   // consume newline
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        double marks = sc.nextDouble();

        Student s = new Student(rollNo, name, marks);
        s.displayDetails();
    }
}
‚ùå Problem:

this keyword is not used, so constructor parameters just assign to themselves (instance variables remain uninitialized).

Output will show default values like 0, null, 0.0.

üîπ Correct Code (after debugging)
import java.util.Scanner;

class Student {
    int rollNo;
    String name;
    double marks;
    static int count = 0;

    Student(int rollNo, String name, double marks) {
        this.rollNo = rollNo;   // ‚úÖ Correct usage of this
        this.name = name;       // ‚úÖ Correct usage of this
        this.marks = marks;     // ‚úÖ Correct usage of this
        count++;                // ‚úÖ Static variable keeps track of total students
    }

    void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Roll No: " + rollNo);
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);

        double marks = sc.nextDouble();

        Student s = new Student(rollNo, name, marks);
        s.displayDetails();
    }
}
‚úÖ Now:

Instance variables are assigned correctly using this.

count correctly tracks total students created.

Output matches the sample.

Would you like me to also extend the problem so that multiple students can be entered (say N students), and the static counter updates across all of them? That would make the use of static more meaningful.

Got it üëç You‚Äôd like a different scenario-based problem statement (still on this and static keywords) but with a little more logic involved.
Here‚Äôs a fresh one in the same format as before:

Problem Statement
Ravi is building a bank account management system. Each account should have an account number, account holder name, and balance.

The this keyword must be used to correctly assign constructor parameters to instance variables.

A static variable should be used to keep track of the total number of accounts created.

A method deposit(double amount) should allow adding money to the balance.

A method withdraw(double amount) should deduct money only if the balance is sufficient, otherwise display "Insufficient Balance".

However, the current implementation has issues:

The this keyword is missing, so account details are not assigned properly.

The static counter is not updated correctly.

The withdrawal logic is faulty, allowing balance to go negative.

Your task is to debug the code so that account details and transactions work as expected.

Input Format
The input contains details for a single account:

An integer accountNo representing the account number.

A string holderName representing the account holder‚Äôs name.

A double balance representing the initial balance.

A double depositAmount representing the money to be deposited.

A double withdrawAmount representing the money to be withdrawn.

Output Format
For each account, the program should print:

Account No: <account_no>
Holder Name: <account_holder>
Balance after deposit: <balance_after_deposit>
Balance after withdrawal: <balance_after_withdrawal or 'Insufficient Balance'>
Total Accounts: <count>
Constraints
1 ‚â§ accountNo ‚â§ 99999

0.0 ‚â§ balance ‚â§ 1000000.0

500.0
2000.0
Sample Output 1
Account No: 5001

Problem Statement
Neha is working on a library management system where each book has a book ID, title, and price.

She wants to create a Book class that:

Uses the this keyword in the constructor to correctly assign values to instance variables.

Uses a static variable to keep track of the total number of books created.

Includes a method applyDiscount(double percentage) that reduces the price of a book by the given discount percentage.

Ensures that the discounted price never goes below 100.0 (minimum threshold).

However, the current implementation has issues:

The this keyword is not used properly, so the book details are not stored.

The static counter is not updating correctly.

The discount logic reduces the price even below the allowed threshold.

Your task is to debug the code to make the library system work as expected.

Input Format
The input contains details for a single book:

An integer bookId representing the book‚Äôs ID.

A string title representing the book‚Äôs title.

A double price representing the book‚Äôs price.

A double discount representing the discount percentage to be applied.

Output Format
For each book, the program should print:

Book ID: <book_id>
Title: <book_title>
Price after discount: <final_price>
Total Books: <count>
Constraints
1 ‚â§ bookId ‚â§ 9999

60.0
Sample Output 2
Book ID: 202
Title: Algorithms
Price after discount: 100.0
Total Books: 1
(Here discount would reduce price to 60, but since minimum allowed is 100, it is set to 100.)

Used this to assign constructor parameters to instance variables.

Added totalCars++ to keep track of registered cars.

Corrected discount logic (used 0.10 instead of 10/100).

Output matches required format.

Would you like me to now design a multi-object version (e.g., handling multiple cars with a loop), so the static counter really shows cumulative cars registered across all inputs?

Perfect üëå Let‚Äôs create a new unique scenario around this and static in Java with some logical twist.

Problem Statement
Kavya is building a fitness tracking system where each member has a member ID, name, and calories burned per workout session.

She wants to create a Member class that:

Uses the this keyword in the constructor to properly assign instance variables.

Uses a static variable to keep track of the total number of members registered.

Provides a method totalCalories(int sessions) to calculate the total calories burned across multiple sessions.

If the total calories burned by a member exceed 5000, they should be labeled as "Fitness Champ", otherwise "Keep Going".

However, the current implementation is buggy:

The this keyword is missing in the constructor, so instance variables remain unassigned.

The static counter is not updated correctly.

The logic for checking "Fitness Champ" is not implemented properly.

Your task is to debug the code so that the fitness tracking system works correctly.

Input Format
The input contains details for a single member:

An integer memberId representing the member‚Äôs ID.

A string name representing the member‚Äôs name.

A double caloriesPerSession representing calories burned in one session.

An integer sessions representing the number of sessions completed.

Output Format
For each member, the program should print:

Member ID: <member_id>
Name: <member_name>
Total Calories Burned: <total_calories>
Status: <Fitness Champ/Keep Going>
Total Members: <count>
Constraints
1 ‚â§ memberId ‚â§ 9999

50.0 ‚â§ caloriesPerSession ‚â§ 1000.0

1 ‚â§ sessions ‚â§ 100

Sample Input 1

Kavya
300.0

Sample Output 1
Member ID: 401
Name: Kavya
Total Calories Burned: 3000.0

Problem Statement
Meera is developing an online course enrollment system where each student has a student ID, name, and course fee.

She wants to design a Course class that:

Uses the this keyword to properly assign constructor parameters to instance variables.

Uses a static variable to track the total number of students enrolled across all courses.

Provides a method applyScholarship(double percentage) that reduces the course fee by the given percentage.

Ensures that the course fee never falls below 500.0, even after applying the scholarship.

Determines whether the student is enrolled as a "Premium Learner" (if final fee ‚â• 5000) or a "Regular Learner" (if final fee < 5000).

However, the current implementation is buggy:

The constructor doesn‚Äôt use this properly, leaving fields uninitialized.

The static counter isn‚Äôt updating correctly.

The scholarship logic allows fees to fall below 500.0.

The learner status is determined incorrectly.

Your task is to debug the code so that the course enrollment system works as expected.

Input Format
The input contains details for a single student enrollment:

An integer studentId representing the student‚Äôs ID.

A string name representing the student‚Äôs name.

A double courseFee representing the base course fee.

A double scholarship representing the percentage of scholarship offered.

Output Format
For each student enrollment, the program should print:

Student ID: <student_id>
Name: <student_name>
Final Course Fee: <final_fee>
Status: <Premium Learner/Regular Learner>
Total Enrollments: <count>
Constraints

The constructor doesn‚Äôt use this, so instance variables are uninitialized.

The static counter is not updated.

The GST and discount logic are not applied correctly.

The minimum price threshold check is missing.

Your task is to debug the code so that the shopping cart system works correctly.

Input Format
The input contains details for a single product:

An integer productId representing the product‚Äôs ID.

A string name representing the product‚Äôs name.

A double price representing the base price of the product.

Output Format
For each product, the program should print:

Product ID: <product_id>
Name: <product_name>
Final Price: <final_price>
Total Products: <count>
Constraints
1 ‚â§ productId ‚â§ 9999

500.0 ‚â§ price ‚â§ 50000.0

Sample Input 1
701
Laptop
45000.0
Sample Output 1
Product ID: 701
Name: Laptop
Final Price: 47700.0
Total Products: 1
(Here: Base = 45000, GST = +8100 ‚Üí 53100, Discount = -5310 ‚Üí 47790. Final = 47790.0)

Sample Input 2
702
Headphones
800.0
Sample Output 2
Product ID: 702
Name: Headphones
Final Price: 1000.0
Total Products: 1
(Here: Base = 800, GST = +144 ‚Üí 944, but since final < 1000, it is adjusted to 1000.0)

Problem Statement
Arjun is designing a Library Membership Management System where each member has a member ID, name, and annual subscription fee.

He wants to create a Member class that:

Uses the this keyword to correctly initialize instance variables in the constructor.

Uses a static variable to keep track of the total number of members registered.

Provides a method applyDiscount(int booksBorrowed) that applies discounts on subscription fees based on the number of books borrowed in the year:

Borrowed ‚â• 50 books ‚Üí 20% discount

Borrowed 30‚Äì49 books ‚Üí 10% discount

Borrowed < 30 books ‚Üí no discount

Ensures the minimum subscription fee never falls below 500.0 after discount.

Classifies members as:

"Gold Member" if final subscription fee ‚â• 2000.

"Silver Member" otherwise.

However, the current implementation is buggy:

The constructor doesn‚Äôt use this, so instance variables are uninitialized.

An integer memberId representing the member‚Äôs ID.

A string name representing the member‚Äôs name.

A double subscriptionFee representing the annual subscription fee.

An integer booksBorrowed representing the number of books borrowed in the year.

Output Format
For each member, the program should print:

The constructor doesn‚Äôt use this, so values are not set correctly.

The static counter for total accounts is missing.

Withdraw logic doesn‚Äôt check minimum balance condition.

Interest calculation is wrong.

Your task is to debug the code so that the bank account management system works as expected.

Input Format
The input contains details for a single bank account:

An integer accountNumber representing the account number.

A string holderName representing the account holder‚Äôs name.

A double balance representing the opening balance.

A double depositAmount representing how much to deposit.

A double withdrawAmount representing how much to withdraw.

Output Format
For each account, the program should print:

Account Number: <account_number>
Holder Name: <holder_name>
Final Balance: <balance_after_transactions>
Total Accounts: <count>
Constraints
1000 ‚â§ accountNumber ‚â§ 99999

Used this in constructor to properly assign values.

Added totalAccounts++ to track number of accounts created.

Fixed withdraw logic: ensures minimum balance of 500.0.

Corrected monthly interest calculation: (balance * interestRate / 12).

Output matches the expected results.

üëâ Do you want me to extend this system to handle multiple accounts (N accounts) so that static totalAccounts shows the count across all accounts?

Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs build another new scenario-based problem statement on this & static keywords in Java, with some fresh logic.

Problem Statement
Arjun is developing a Student Grade Management System for a university. Each student has a roll number, name, and marks in three subjects.

He wants to design a Student class that:

Uses the this keyword in the constructor to properly initialize instance variables.

Uses a static variable to keep track of the total number of students registered.

Provides a method calculateAverage() to compute the average marks of a student.

Provides a method assignGrade() which assigns a grade based on the average marks:

Average ‚â• 90 ‚Üí Grade = "A"

Average ‚â• 75 ‚Üí Grade = "B"

Average ‚â• 50 ‚Üí Grade = "C"

Otherwise ‚Üí Grade = "F"

Ensures that marks cannot exceed 100 or fall below 0. If invalid marks are entered, they should be reset to 0.

However, the current implementation has issues:

The constructor does not use this, so values are not initialized correctly.

The static counter for total students is missing.

Invalid marks validation is not handled.

Grade calculation logic is incorrect.

Your task is to debug the code so that the student grade management system works properly.

Input Format
The input contains details for a single student:

An integer rollNumber representing the student‚Äôs roll number.

A string name representing the student‚Äôs name.

Three integers mark1, mark2, mark3 representing marks in three subjects.

Output Format
For each student, the program should print:

Roll Number: <roll_number>
Name: <student_name>
Average Marks: <average>
Grade: <grade>
Total Students: <count>
Constraints
1 ‚â§ rollNumber ‚â§ 9999

0 ‚â§ marks ‚â§ 100 (if invalid, reset to 0)

Sample Input 1

Sample Output 2
Roll Number: 102
Name: Meera
Average Marks: 23.333333333333332
Grade: F
Total Students: 1
(Here: Invalid marks 105 ‚Üí reset to 0, -5 ‚Üí reset to 0, so marks = {0,70,0} ‚Üí average = 23.33 ‚Üí Grade F)
